# Description
System Software project done at a course called System Software at School of Electrical Engineering, Belgrade.

This project is concerned with implementing a complete toolchain for translating an assembly (.s) file into executable machine code, modeled after the GNU toolchain tools.

## Technologies used:

* FLEX (utilized as part of the lexing process)
* BISON (utilized as a part of aprsing processs)
* The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) (used in conjunction with C++ to facilitate the implementation of data structures and operations performed on them)
* Make (used to automate the building and compilation of project by specifying dependencies and the steps required to build the project)

## Functionalities:

* Parser and Lexer
* First and second pass assembler
* Linker
* Emulator

### Make commands:

* make all (for starting the make script and making the files)
